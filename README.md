# Lotide Library
*W01D1 + W01D2*

## Contents
* assertEqual() - returns a message for assertion pass or fail based on two arguments (actual, expected)
* head() - returns the first element of an array
* tail() - returns a new array that contains all the elements of an inputted array expect for index0 ("the head of the inputted array")
* eqArrays() - returns assertion after comparing two arrays (utilitzes assertEqual() for assertion)
* assertArraysEqual() - returns a console.log with appropriate assert message after comparing two arrays 
* without() - returns a new array after removing items from a source array (takes in two arrays as parameters/arguments)
* withoutAlternative() - same as without() but alternative way of writing the code for it
* withoutAlternative2() - an even more refracted way of wrting without()
* flatten() - condenses nested arrays (one nested level in) into a one level array
* middle () - returns the middle element(s) of an array (as an array; also contains assertion message)
* countOnly() - returns an object that is the result of counting certain items in an array (based on criteria listed in another object)
* countLetters() - returns an object that is the result of counting letters in a sentence (no spaces)
* letterPositions() - returns an object that contains keys (letters in sentence) and values (indexes in which they appear in sentence)
* findKeyByValue() - returns the name of the key that contains the value that is the same as an inputted one
* eqObject() - compares if two objects are the same assuming all values are arrays or primitive data (i.e. no values are objects)
